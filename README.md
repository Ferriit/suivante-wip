# suivante-wip

This is a Work-In-Progress of another custom language called Suivante. This is specifically a transpiler that transpiles it into C. So far I've implemented a tokenizer and have started to actually turn it into C code. (Though I have a problem where the For-loops aren't showing up when transpiling to C)
